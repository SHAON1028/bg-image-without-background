# Background Image Card Component

This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to create a card component overlaid on a background image. The background image fills the entire container, while the card floats on top of it with text content and tags.

## Features

- **Full-Width Background Image**: The background image takes up the full width and height of its container.
- **Overlay Card**: A card component with text and image floats over the background image.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
